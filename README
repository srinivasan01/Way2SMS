This is an API for sending sms through the way2sms(http://www.way2sms.com) service.Way2SMS has no official API for their service as yet and going to their website, logging in , clicking on links and sending a message (not to forget closing those annoying pop-up ads !) was too much of work for me ;).So,i decided to automate the process,hence this API.You can use it as follows:

from Way2SMS import sms
s = sms.Way2SMS('<your_mobile_number>','<your_way2sms_password>')
s.send('<receipient_number>','<message>')

Thats it !.Hope you find this useful.You may also use it in your own programs, web apps etc.You can send me your feedback,bug reports and submit patches by sending me an email at raza.sayed@gmail.com. Have fun ! :)
